    "# Just kidding, no one starts their stories that way, even though variables are where all data stories begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variables define datasets. They are the characteristics or attributes that we evaluate during data collection. There are two ways to do that evaluation: we can measure or we can categorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How we evaluate determines what kind of variable we have. Since there are only two ways to get data, there are only two types of variables: numerical and categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A box labeled \"Variables\" points to two boxes below labeled \"Categorical\" and \"Quantitative\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Every observation (the individuals or objects we are collecting data about) is classified according to its characteristics. In “flat” file formats (like tables, csvs, or DataFrames), the observations are the rows, the variables are the columns, and the values are at the intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We’ll go deeper into categorical and numerical variables in the following exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Typically, the best way to understand your data is to look at a sample of it.\n",

    "# There are several types of variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The price column describes how much the cereal costs. We don’t know if that’s how much the consumer pays or the grocer pays, but we can be fairly sure that it’s a numerical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the mfr column, there are labels like Nestle, Quaker Oats, and Kelloggs, which seem like brands. Since brands are categories, mfr is most likely a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The id column also has numbers, but we can assume that since it’s the id, it’s not actually representing a value. It’s probably the label for the observation. Since it’s a label, even though it’s a number, id is a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# If we were downloading this from a data repository, we would expect a data dictionary to define these variables and validate (or invalidate) our assumptions.\n",

    "# Categorical Variables\n",
    "# Without getting too philosophical about it, “your mind is a categorization machine” - HBR. We move through the world by categorizing things into various groups: safe/unsafe, best/worst, on/off. These categorizations help us process information. They also create major problems for us when we over-categorize, and can lead to bias and unfair assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# However, we still do it, and regardless of the dangers, categorization helps us transform the world around us into data. (Being aware of the dangers is a crucial part of data analysis, but outside the scope of this lesson.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Categorical variables come in 3 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nominal variables, which describe something,\n",
    "# Ordinal variables, which have an inherent ranking, and\n",
    "# Binary variables, which have only two possible variations.\n",
    "# one box with 'Nominal variables' written in it and 3 boxes blow it with 'Nominal', 'Ordinal', and 'Binary' below, illustrating the relationship between each of these types of variables and nominal variables\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let’s look at each one separately\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nominal Variables\n",
    "# When we want to describe something about the world, we need a nominal variable. Nominal variables are usually words (i.e., red, yellow, blue or hot, cold), but they can also be numbers (i.e., zip codes or user id’s).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Often, nominal variables describe something with a lot of variation. It can be hard to capture all of that variation, so an ‘Other’ category is often necessary. For example, in the case of color, we could have a lot of different labels, but might still need an ‘Other’ category to capture anything we missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal variables\n",
    "# When our categories have an inherent order, we need an ordinal variable. Ordinal variables are usually described by numbers like 1st, 2nd, 3rd. Places in a race, grades in school, and the scales in survey responses (Likert Scales) are ordinal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinal variables can be a little tricky because even though they are numbers, it doesn’t make sense to do math on them. For example, let’s say an Olympian won a Gold medal (1st place) and a Bronze medal (3rd place). We wouldn’t say that they averaged Silver medals (2nd place).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Though there is some debate about whether Likert scales should be treated like intervals or ordinal categories, most statisticians agree that they are ordinal categories and therefore should not be summarized numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Binary variables\n",
    "# When there are only two logically possible variations, we need a binary variable. Binary variables are things like on/off, yes/no, and TRUE/FALSE. If there is any possibility of a third option, it is not a binary variable.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# one box labeled 'Numerical' with two boxes below it labeled 'Continous' and 'Discrete' to represent the relationship between the three terms\n",
    "\n",
    "# Continuous variables come from measurements. For a variable to be continuous, there must be infinitely smaller units of measurement between one unit and the next unit. Continuous variables can be represented by decimal places (but because of rounding, sometimes they are whole numbers). Length, time, and temperature are all good examples of continuous variables because they all increase continuously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discrete variables come from counting. For a variable to be discrete, there must be gaps between the smallest possible units. People, cars, and dogs are all good examples of discrete variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some variables depend on context to determine if they are continuous or discrete. Money and time can both be measured continuously or discretely.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For money, all currencies have a smallest-possible-unit (i.e., the cent in USD) and are therefore discrete. However, banks and other institutions sometimes measure money in fractions of a cent, treating it like a continuous variable.\n",

    "# VARIABLE TYPES\n",
    "# Changing Numerical Variable Data Types\n",
    "# Congratulations - being able to identify variable types is the first (and most important) step towards working with data. The next is understanding how Python (and the pandas library) store your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you read a data file (such as a csv) with pandas, data types are assigned to each column. Pandas does its best to predict what kind of data type each variable should contain. For example, if a column contains only integer values, it will be stored as an int32 or int64. This usually works, but problems can arise for our analysis later on when there’s a mismatch between the real-world variable type and the data type pandas assigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# With numerical variables, pandas expects any column that has decimal values to be a float and anything without decimal values to be an integer. If any non-numeric characters appear in the column, pandas will treat it as an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It’s possible to determine the data types of the columns in your DataFrame with the .dtypes attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, in our cereal dataset, Pandas returned the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(cereal.dtypes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# name\tobject\n",
    "# id\tint64\n",
    "# name\tobject\n",
    "# mfr\tobject\n",
    "# type\tobject\n",

    "# vitamins\tint64\n",
    "# coupons\tint64\n",
    "# price\tfloat64\n",
    "# dtype: object\t\n",
    "# Best practices for data storage say that we should match the data type of the column with its real-world variable type. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Continuous (numerical) variables should usually be stored as the float data type because they allow us to store decimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Discrete (numerical) variables should be stored as the int datatype to represent mathematically that they are discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "# (note that the difference between int32/int64 and float32/float64 does not concern us here – it is an issue for much larger numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using float and int to store quantitative variables is important so that you can later perform numerical operations on those values. It also helps indicate what the variables refer to in the real world. Keeping them separate helps ensure that we perform the right calculations and get the right results. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "# If a variable appears with the wrong data type, we can change it with the .astype() function.\n",

    "# One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "# In the previous exercise, we saw how label encoding can be useful for ordinal categorical variables. But sometimes we need a different approach. This could be because:\n",
    "\n",
    "# We have a nominal categorical variable (like breed of dog), so it doesn’t really make sense to assign numbers like 0,1,2,3,4,5 to our categories, as this could create an order among the species that is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We have an ordinal categorical variable but we don’t want to assume that there’s equal spacing between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another way of encoding categorical variables is called One-Hot Encoding (OHE). With OHE, we essentially create a new binary variable for each of the categories within our original variable. This technique is useful when managing nominal variables because it encodes the variable without creating an order among the categories.\n",

    "# To perform OHE on a variable within a pandas dataframe, we can use the pandas .get_dummies() method which creates a binary or “dummy” variable for each category.

The pd.get_dummies() method will also work on data types other than category.\n",
